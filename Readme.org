* phi-search.el

multiple-cursors.el対応の劣化isearch

inferior isearch compatible with "multiple-cursors"

** THE VERSION 1.1.0 BROKE BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY

"phi-search-keybindings" is now removed and, "phi-search-mode-map" is
available instead. To change keybindings, DO NOT use
"phi-search-keybindings" but USE "phi-search-mode-map".

** Screencast

** Usage

Require this script

: (require 'phi-search)

then a command "phi-search" is available. You may bind a key to the
command.

: (global-set-key (kbd "C-s") 'phi-search)

When the command is called, a small window appears at the bottom of
the current window. Input query there in (emacs) regular expression to
start searching. In the window, following commands are available.

- [C-s] phi-search-again-or-next

  Move to the next matching item. If query is blank, use the last
  query.

- [C-r] phi-search-again-or-previous

  Similar to phi-search-again-or-next, but move to the previous item.

- [RET] phi-search-complete

  Finish searching.

- [C-g] phi-search-abort

  Finish searching, and move back to the original position.

** Working with Regions

(in following examples, assume "[" as mark, and "|" as point)

When phi-search is called with an active region, then the substring is
used as the default query.

: [region| another region   |region another region   region another |region
: _______________________   ______________________   ______________________
:                           query: region            query: region

Or, if phi-search is called with an active mark but no region there,
mark stays active until phi-search ends. So you may use this command
to expand region.

: [|mark me !   [|mark me !   [mark |me !
: ___________   ___________   ___________
:               query:        query: me

** Working with multiple-cursors.el

phi-search is available even when multiple-cursors-mode is
active. Here are some examples.

: |foo bar baz   |foo bar baz   foo bar |baz
: |foo bar baz   |foo bar baz   foo bar |baz
: ____________   ____________   ____________
:                query:         query: baz

: [|mark us !                 [|mark us !                 [mark |us !
: [|mark us with a region !   [|mark us with a region !   [mark |us with a region !
: _________________________   _________________________   _________________________
:                             query:                      query: us

: [foo| ABC foo       |foo ABC foo       foo ABC |foo
: [bar| EFGHIJK bar   |bar EFGHIJK bar   bar EFGHIJK |bar
: _________________   ________________   ________________
:                     query: foo         query: foo

*** How This Works with multiple-cursors ?

"multiple-cursors" will repeat commands with fake cursors, in
"post-command-hook". The command "phi-search" will open a new buffer
named *phi-search* to read a query. So "post-command-hook" for the
command runs in *phi-search* buffer. Currently, "multiple-cursors"
works buffer locally. Therefore, even when multiple-cursrors-mode is
enabled, *phi-search* buffer is not affected.

When "phi-search-complete" is called, phi-search will generate a
command that is repeatable for fake cursors, and set the command to
"this-original-command" and "mc--this-command". Then go back to the
buffer where phi-search is called from. "post-command-hook" for the
command runs here, and the generated command will be repeated with
fake cursors instead.

Seen from "multiple-cursors", whole search

: "phi-search" -> input query -> select an item -> "phi-search-complete"

is the generated command.

** Customization

You may change keybindings by changing "phi-search-mode-map", and
limit of search by "phi-search-limit".

: (define-key phi-search-mode-map (kbd "<") 'phi-search-again-or-previous)
: (define-key phi-search-mode-map (kbd ">") 'phi-search-again-or-next)
:
: (setq phi-search-limit 500)

Matching items are propertized with "phi-search-match-face", and the
selected item is propertized with "phi-search-selection-face". If they
look not pretty in your colorscheme, you may modify them.

: (set-face-attribute 'phi-search-selection-face nil
:                     :background "orange")

** Notes

This command uses "multiple-cursors" variables and behavior that are
not documented. Therefore, after you update "multiple-cursors", it is
good idea to test if this command works still correctly, before you
use this command actually.
